# Contributing Guidelines

As we work with each other this semester, there are a few things we can all do
to help make life easier for each other.

1. When writing code, write plenty of comments, and most importantly write
   module-level and function-level comments to describe the functionality of a
   section of code.

2. Prefer descriptive names over short or succinct names. Try to make the
   purpose of your code clear even if the comments were to be removed.

3. Do not commit build artifacts or package files to the repo. If needed, add
   lines to the `.gitignore` file to keep out unwanted additions.

4. Keep your code well-formatted. In particular, be consistent in your
   indentation and use a thoughful amount of whitespace. If a file is getting
   large, split it into smaller files that are easier to reason about.
